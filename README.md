### Hello, my name is Anthony. Welcome to my Github profile 👋

🕹️🖌️ I'm a full stack developer who is passionate about the front end and all things games related.  

👨🏻‍💻 For work I specialise in these buzzwords: React, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Accessibility, UX with C# or Node on the backend.

🎮 For personal projects I'm currently focusing on bringing retro games to the web using the Canvas element and browser technologies. Where I'm currently working on a Street Fighter 2 clone 🐲👊

🎨 I also from time to time like call myself an artist, on the side. Where I tend to paint portraits and landscapes in the traditional style. 

However, a lot of my recent repostories are private for various reasons :( But why not check out my YouTube channel to see what I'm currently working on ⚡

### Hello, my name is Anthony. Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

🕹️🖌️ I'm a full-stack developer with 20+ years experience developing software. I'm passionate about the front-end, developing software with the user in mind and all things games-related.

👨🏻‍💻 For work I specialise in these buzzwords: React, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Accessibility, and UX with C# or Node on the backend. I've also been known to dabble with C and/or assembler for various machines over the years.

🎮 For personal projects I'm currently focusing on bringing retro games to the web using the HTML canvas element and browser technologies. I'm currently working on bringing Street Fighter 2 🐲👊 and a Bomberman 💣🔥 clone to the web using no frameworks.

🎨 I also occasionally like to call myself an artist, on the side. Where I tend to paint portraits and landscapes in the traditional style.

However, a lot of my recent repositories are private for various reasons 😇 But why not check out my YouTube channel to see what I'm currently working on ⚡
